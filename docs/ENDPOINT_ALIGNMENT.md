## Conclusion

Our endpoint structure successfully maintains strong alignment with both the Substrate framework's systematic thinking approach and the Daemon project's personal API vision. The 18% of extensions enhance functionality without compromising the core vision, adding valuable capabilities for goal management, enhanced networking, and financial transparency.

The integration represents a successful synthesis of:
