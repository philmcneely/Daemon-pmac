## Problem
The CI workflow had a YAML syntax error due to incorrect indentation on line 54, causing builds to fail with:
```
/home/runner/work/_temp/523aef2c-1dfc-45ae-996d-e3949c9f688f.sh: line 10: syntax error near unexpected token `('
```

## Solution
- Fixed malformed YAML structure with incorrectly indented step
- Removed extra spaces that caused the syntax error
- Validated YAML syntax locally before committing

## Testing
- [x] YAML syntax validated with `python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/ci.yml'))"`
- [x] Pre-commit hooks passed
- [ ] CI pipeline should now run without YAML parsing errors

This fixes the immediate CI syntax error and allows the pipeline to proceed with running the actual tests.
