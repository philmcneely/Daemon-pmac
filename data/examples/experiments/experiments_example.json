The practice also produced unexpected benefits in emotional regulation and overall well-being.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Continue 10-minute daily practice\n- Experiment with longer sessions (15-20 minutes) for 4 weeks\n- Track additional metrics: creativity scores and problem-solving speed\n- Share findings with team for potential group practice\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n- Consistency matters more than session length\n- Benefits compound over time - breakthrough came in week 5-6\n- Morning timing crucial for establishing habit\n- Measuring subjective experience alongside objective metrics provides fuller picture",
