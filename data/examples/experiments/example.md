### Experiment: Daily Meditation for Focus

**Hypothesis:** 10 minutes of daily meditation will increase sustained attention by at least 20% as measured by Pomodoro session completion rates.

#### Method
- **Duration:** 8 weeks (January 2 - February 26, 2025)
- **Meditation:** 10 minutes each morning using Headspace app
- **Measurement:** Track Pomodoro sessions (25-minute focused work blocks)
- **Baseline:** 4-week average before starting meditation
- **Tools:** Toggl for time tracking, daily logs for subjective focus rating (1-10)

#### Baseline Metrics (Pre-Meditation)
- Average completed Pomodoros per day: 6.2
- Average focus rating: 6.4/10
- Interruption frequency: 3.1 per session
- Deep work session duration: 47 minutes average

#### Week-by-Week Results

**Week 1-2: Establishing Routine**
- Completed Pomodoros: 5.8/day (slight decrease due to morning routine adjustment)
- Focus rating: 6.1/10
- Observations: Difficulty maintaining morning consistency, some resistance

**Week 3-4: Finding Rhythm**
- Completed Pomodoros: 7.1/day (+14.5% from baseline)
- Focus rating: 7.2/10
- Observations: Morning routine becoming automatic, less mental chatter during work

**Week 5-6: Breakthrough Period**
- Completed Pomodoros: 7.8/day (+25.8% from baseline)
- Focus rating: 7.8/10
- Observations: Noticing gaps between thoughts, easier task switching

**Week 7-8: Sustained Improvement**
- Completed Pomodoros: 7.6/day (+22.6% from baseline)
- Focus rating: 7.9/10
- Observations: Less reactive to interruptions, improved emotional regulation

#### Final Results
- **Primary Metric:** 22.6% improvement in completed Pomodoros (exceeded 20% hypothesis)
- **Secondary Metrics:**
  - Focus rating improved 23.4% (6.4 to 7.9)
  - Interruption frequency decreased to 1.8 per session (-42%)
  - Deep work sessions averaged 68 minutes (+44%)

#### Qualitative Observations
- **Stress Response:** Noticeably calmer when handling urgent requests
- **Decision Making:** Less impulsive, more thoughtful responses
- **Energy Levels:** More sustained energy throughout the day
- **Sleep Quality:** Improved sleep onset time and deeper rest

#### Unexpected Benefits
- Better listening skills in meetings
- Increased empathy and patience with team members
- More creative problem-solving approaches
- Reduced caffeine dependency

#### Challenges
- **Consistency:** Missed 6 days total due to travel and illness
- **Skepticism:** Initial doubt about "soft skills" impacting technical work
- **Time Management:** Required adjustment to morning routine

#### Conclusions
**Hypothesis Confirmed:** Daily meditation significantly improved sustained attention beyond the predicted 20% threshold.

**Key Insight:** The benefits extended beyond pure focus to include emotional regulation and interpersonal skills, suggesting meditation's impact on professional performance is broader than anticipated.

**Recommendation:** Continue practice with potential expansion to 15-minute sessions for additional benefits.

#### Next Experiments
1. **Walking Meetings:** Test impact on creativity and problem-solving
2. **Focus Music:** Compare different audio environments for deep work
3. **Time-blocking:** Structured scheduling vs. flexible prioritization
