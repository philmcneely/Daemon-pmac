New Providence has shown us glimpses of this possibility - pirates governing themselves through elected captains, shared articles, and democratic vote on major decisions. We could expand this model.",

A carefully cultivated fearsome appearance - the burning matches in my beard, the multiple pistols, the dramatic black clothing - can secure surrender without a single shot fired. This psychological warfare saves lives on both sides while achieving the same objectives. Perhaps this principle could revolutionize naval warfare entirely.",

The Charleston blockade proved this - five days of blocking one port and the entire colonial government bent to our demands.",
