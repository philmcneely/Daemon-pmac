Good programmers write code that humans can understand.\"*\n\n#### Why This Book Changed My Programming:\n\n**Before reading Clean Code:**\n- Wrote functional but messy code\n- Struggled with maintaining large codebases\n- Spent too much time debugging\n\n**After applying its principles:**\n- Code reviews became discussions, not battles\n- Debugging time reduced by ~60%\n- New team members onboard faster\n\n#### Most Impactful Chapters:\n1. **Functions** - Single responsibility principle\n2. **Naming** - Intent-revealing names\n3. **Comments** - When to use them (and when not to)\n\n#### Quick Reference Rules:\n- Functions should do one thing\n- Names should reveal intent\n- Comments explain *why*, not *what*\n- Keep it simple (KISS principle)\n\n**Reread frequency:** Every 2-3 years to reinforce habits",
