# Solutions Endpoint Examples

This directory contains examples for the `/api/v1/solutions` endpoint.

## Purpose

The solutions endpoint is designed for **solutions and approaches to problems, both personal and broader challenges**. This aligns with both the Substrate framework's systematic approach to problem-solving and the Daemon project's personal API concept.

## Content Structure

Solution entries should follow the content/meta format and include:

### Core Components
- **Solution Category**: Type of solution (Technical, Process, Strategic, Personal, etc.)
- **Related Problem**: Clear connection to specific problems being addressed
- **Status**: Implementation state (Proposed, In Progress, Implemented, Evaluated)
- **Effectiveness**: Assessment of solution success (Low, Medium, High, Excellent)

### Analysis Sections
- **Overview**: Clear explanation of the solution approach
- **Core Components**: Key elements and features
- **Implementation Steps**: Actionable plan with timeline
- **Success Metrics**: Measurable indicators of success
- **Lessons Learned**: Insights gained from implementation
- **Future Enhancements**: Potential improvements and extensions

### Format
Each solution should be structured as markdown content with:
- Clear headings and logical organization
- Actionable implementation details
- Measurable success criteria
- Connection to related problems

## Example Files

- `example.md` - Comprehensive solution examples covering technical, organizational, and strategic solutions
- Additional solution files can be added as needed

## Usage

These examples can be imported via:
```bash
python -m app.cli import solutions path/to/solutions/file.json
```

Or through the API:
```bash
POST /api/v1/solutions
```

## Integration with Problems

Solutions should reference and connect to problems defined in the `/api/v1/problems` endpoint, creating a coherent problem-solution mapping that supports systematic thinking and analysis.
