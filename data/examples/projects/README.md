# Projects Endpoint Documentation

The `/projects` endpoint provides a flexible way to store and manage project information using pure markdown content. Unlike other endpoints with structured schemas, projects support completely flexible formatting allowing users to organize their project information however makes sense to them.

## Key Features

- **Pure Markdown Content**: No rigid schema - organize projects however you prefer
- **Flexible Structure**: Support for any project format (technical specs, volunteer work, personal projects, etc.)
- **Rich Formatting**: Full markdown support including code blocks, tables, links, and media
- **Individual Management**: Add, edit, replace, or delete projects independently
- **Privacy Controls**: Automatic privacy filtering based on user settings
- **Multi-User Support**: User-specific project collections in multi-user mode

## API Endpoints

### Single User Mode
```bash
GET    /api/v1/projects              # List all projects
POST   /api/v1/projects              # Create new project
PUT    /api/v1/projects/{id}         # Update/replace project
DELETE /api/v1/projects/{id}         # Delete project
POST   /api/v1/projects/bulk         # Create multiple projects
```

### Multi-User Mode
```bash
GET    /api/v1/projects/users/{username}    # Get user's projects
POST   /api/v1/projects/users/{username}    # Create project for user
PUT    /api/v1/projects/{id}/users/{username}  # Update user's project
DELETE /api/v1/projects/{id}/users/{username}  # Delete user's project
```

## Data Structure

Projects use a simple, flexible structure with only one required field:

```json
{
  "content": "# Your Project Title\n\nAny markdown content here..."
}
```

The `content` field contains pure markdown text that can be structured however you prefer.

## API Usage

### Creating a Project

```bash
curl -X POST \"http://localhost:8000/api/v1/projects\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"content\": \"# New Project\\n\\nProject description here...\"\n  }'
```

```

### Searching Projects

```bash
# Search for projects containing specific terms\ncurl \"http://localhost:8000/api/v1/projects?search=Python\"\n\n# Pagination\ncurl \"http://localhost:8000/api/v1/projects?limit=5&offset=10\"\n\n# Privacy filtering\ncurl \"http://localhost:8000/api/v1/projects?privacy_level=public_full\"\n```

```

## Advanced Markdown Features

The projects endpoint supports all standard markdown features:

### Code Blocks
```python
def create_project(content: str):\n    return {\"content\": content}\n```

### Tables
| Feature | Status | Priority |\n|---------|--------|----------|\n| Authentication | ‚úÖ Complete | High |\n| API Endpoints | üîÑ In Progress | Medium |\n| Documentation | ‚ùå Pending | Low |

### Links and Media
- [External Links](https://example.com)\n- ![Images](https://example.com/image.png)\n- Internal references and cross-links

### Special Characters
- Emoji support: üöÄ üéØ üí°\n- Mathematical expressions: E = mc¬≤\n- Unicode symbols: ‚àÄx‚àà‚Ñù, x¬≤ ‚â• 0

## Privacy and Security

Projects respect the same privacy controls as other endpoints:

- **business_card**: Project titles only\n- **professional**: Work-related projects, sanitized personal info\n- **public_full**: All projects with sensitive data removed\n- **ai_safe**: Full content with automatic data sanitization

## File Import

You can import projects from JSON files in the `data/examples/projects/` directory:

```bash\n# Import projects from file\npython -m app.cli import-data projects\n```

The file should contain an array of project objects with \"content\" fields.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Consistent Structure**: While flexible, maintaining some consistency helps with readability\n2. **Rich Content**: Use markdown features to make projects visually appealing\n3. **Regular Updates**: Keep project status and achievements current\n4. **Privacy Awareness**: Consider what information should be public vs. private\n5. **Searchable Content**: Include relevant keywords for easy discovery\n\n## Examples in This Repository\n\nCheck out `data/examples/projects/projects_example.json` for real examples of different project formatting styles.\n
