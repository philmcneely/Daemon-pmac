### Risk: Data Privacy Exposure

**Risk Category:** Operational/Legal
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** High
**Status:** Monitored

#### Description
Potential exposure of personal data through third-party integrations and API endpoints, particularly as the platform scales and integrates with external services.

#### Specific Concerns
- **API Security:** Public endpoints may inadvertently expose private data
- **Third-party Services:** Analytics and monitoring tools collecting more data than necessary
- **User Consent:** Complex consent flows that users don't fully understand
- **Data Retention:** Unclear policies around how long data is stored and when it's deleted

#### Current Mitigation Strategies
1. **Privacy by Design**
   - Default all new endpoints to private visibility
   - Require explicit opt-in for public data sharing
   - Regular privacy impact assessments

2. **Technical Controls**
   - Field-level privacy controls in database
   - Automatic data masking for non-authorized access
   - Regular security audits and penetration testing

3. **Legal Compliance**
   - GDPR compliance framework implementation
   - Clear data processing agreements with vendors
   - Regular review of privacy policies

#### Monitoring & Early Warning Signs
- Increased requests for data export/deletion
- User complaints about unsolicited communications
- Unusual patterns in API access logs
- Reports of data appearing in unexpected contexts

#### Response Plan
1. **Immediate (0-24 hours)**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Assess scope of potential exposure
   - Notify key stakeholders

2. **Short-term (1-7 days)**
   - Implement containment measures
   - Begin user notification process
   - Document incident for regulatory reporting

3. **Long-term (1+ weeks)**
   - Root cause analysis
   - System improvements
   - Updated policies and procedures

#### Recent Updates
- **Q4 2024:** Implemented field-level encryption for sensitive data
- **Q1 2025:** Added automated privacy compliance checking in CI/CD pipeline

#### Next Review Date
March 15, 2025

### Risk: Key Person Dependency

**Risk Category:** Operational
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium-High
**Status:** In Progress

#### Description
Over-reliance on single individuals for critical system knowledge and operations, creating vulnerability if key people become unavailable.

#### Specific Areas of Concern
- **System Architecture:** Primary architect knowledge not fully documented
- **Database Management:** Single DBA with deep institutional knowledge
- **Client Relationships:** Key accounts managed by one person
- **Security Procedures:** Admin access concentrated among too few people

#### Current Mitigation Strategies
1. **Knowledge Documentation**
   - Comprehensive system documentation initiative
   - Video walkthroughs of critical procedures
   - Decision logs with rationale and context

2. **Cross-training Programs**
   - Pair programming for critical components
   - Rotation of on-call responsibilities
   - Mandatory knowledge sharing sessions

3. **Process Automation**
   - Automated deployment and rollback procedures
   - Self-service tools for common operations
   - Monitoring and alerting systems

#### Success Metrics
- Time to resolve incidents when primary person unavailable
- Number of people capable of handling each critical function
- Documentation coverage of critical processes

#### Target State
- Minimum 2 people trained on each critical system
- 90% of procedures documented and tested
- Zero single points of failure in operations

#### Timeline
- Documentation completion: Q2 2025
- Cross-training program: Q3 2025
- Full redundancy achievement: Q4 2025
