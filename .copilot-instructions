# CRITICAL COPILOT RULES - NEVER VIOLATE

## Test-First Development
- ALWAYS update tests when changing functionality
- ALWAYS run tests and ensure they pass before proceeding
- NEVER move to next task until all tests pass and docs updated

## Documentation Updates
- ALWAYS update API_REQUIREMENTS.md when changing API behavior
- ALWAYS update E2E_TEST_CASES_GIVEN_WHEN_THEN.md for new test scenarios
- ALWAYS update OpenAPI documentation for endpoint changes

## Command Output Handling
- ALWAYS pipe GitHub CLI (gh) commands to files in gh_temp/ directory first, then read file
- ALWAYS pipe curl commands to files in gh_temp/ directory first, then read file
- NEVER try to read CLI output directly from terminal

## File Management
- NEVER create extraneous files for one-offs in root directory
- NEVER create duplicate files and leave them around
- ALWAYS clean up temporary files after use
- ALWAYS use gh_temp/ directory for temporary files (gitignored)

## Problem Resolution
- NEVER suppress warnings or add workarounds - ALWAYS fix the root cause
- ALWAYS examine application code first to understand how to perform actions correctly

## Work Completion
- ALWAYS commit changes before summarizing what you've done

## Quality Gates (ALL MUST PASS)
- All existing tests must pass
- New tests must pass
- Documentation updated and accurate
- OpenAPI schema current
- No temporary files in project root

## Python Project Specifics
- Use SQLite with aiosqlite (NOT PostgreSQL)
- Use pip with requirements.txt (NOT Poetry)
- Add detailed headers to .py files, keep .md files clean
- Follow FastAPI + SQLAlchemy async patterns

## Complete Guidelines
- See docs/COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md for comprehensive technical guidelines
- These rules apply FIRST, then supplementary technical rules apply

## Examples:
✅ CORRECT: gh api repos/owner/repo/pulls > gh_temp/pulls.json 2>&1 && cat gh_temp/pulls.json
❌ WRONG: gh api repos/owner/repo/pulls

✅ CORRECT: curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/owner/repo > gh_temp/repo.json 2>&1 && cat gh_temp/repo.json
❌ WRONG: curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/owner/repo
