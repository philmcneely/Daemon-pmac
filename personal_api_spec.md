### Personal API — Monolithic Endpoint Spec (Markdown-ready)

For each new endpoint listed, you need to generate the endpoint, e2e tests and unit tests and update documentation including OpenApi. add an example file in the data\examples dir. each of the new endpoints should allow markdown and not enforce a db schema.  users should be able to customize how they present their data. I want flexible markdown content instead of a rigid JSON schema. remember to account for single user and multi user scenarios in code and tests, review existing code to make sure you understand the behaviour for a single user or multiple users. Make sure you create each endpoint 1 by 1, get it all working, then commit and push after each one is complete.


#### Note up front
- Each endpoint is intentionally flexible: entries are free-text Markdown blocks.
- Implementor suggestion: store each entry as a Markdown file or a DB record with a single free-text Markdown field named `content`. Support optional YAML front-matter (title, date, tags, status, visibility) to provide structure when desired — but do not require it.
- Standard resource operations: GET (list), GET /{id} (single), POST (create), PATCH/PUT (update), DELETE (delete). All request/response bodies carry a minimal object with a Markdown `content` field and optional `meta`.
- Recommended defaults for visibility:
  - Daemon-style personal/public endpoints: default `public`.
  - Telos/Substrate-style strategic or sensitive endpoints: default `private`.
  - Allow per-item override via `meta.visibility`.

---

#### Common payload / response pattern (non-rigid)

- Create / Update request body (JSON):
```json
{
  "content": "### Title

Your markdown content here...",
  "meta": {
    "title": "Optional short title",
    "date": "2025-08-26",
    "tags": ["tag1","tag2"],
    "visibility": "public"
  }
}
```

- GET list response:
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-or-slug-1",
      "content": "### Markdown content...",
      "meta": { "title":"...", "date":"...", "tags":["..."], "visibility":"public" },
      "updated_at":"2025-08-26T12:34:56Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

- GET single response: return a single item object as above.

- Common query params:
  - `?tag=xyz`
  - `?status=ongoing`
  - `?visibility=public`
  - `?format=raw|html` (raw returns markdown, html returns rendered HTML)

- Optional features to implement:
  - Revision history / versioning.
  - Full-text indexing of `content`.
  - `export` endpoints (e.g., `GET /projects/export?format=md`).
  - Per-item `allow_comments` and commenting moderation.
  - Rate limiting and abuse protection on public endpoints.

### Endpoint-level settings (recommended, optional)
- `meta.visibility`: public | unlisted | private (per-item)
- `meta.tags`: array of strings for indexing and filtering
- `meta.status`: optional free text/status (e.g., planned, ongoing, completed)
- `allow_comments`: boolean (per endpoint or per item)
- `render_format` query param: `?format=raw|html`
- `export` support: `GET /{endpoint}/export?format=md|json`

---

### Implementation recommendations for developers
- Storage:
  - Easiest: store content as Markdown blobs with optional YAML front-matter in a DB column (text) or as files in a repository.
  - Alternate: store as files in a Git-backed store for versioning and public diffability.
- Search & indexing:
  - Full-text index `content` and `meta` fields.
  - Index tags, status, dates for efficient filtering.
- Security & privacy:
  - Enforce `visibility` per-item. Public endpoints should have rate limiting.
  - Sensitive endpoints (Telos/Substrate items like `/funding_sources`, `/threats`) default to `private`.
- Rendering:
  - API returns raw Markdown by default; optionally support server-side HTML rendering for `?format=html`.
- Revisions:
  - Preserve change history (who changed what and when).
- API UX:
  - Allow clients to request a single `content` field or a rendered `html` field in responses.
  - Provide simple pagination for GET list responses (cursor or page-based).
- Metadata:
  - Encourage optional `meta` fields but do not make them required.

### Example minimal CRUD flows (illustrative)

- Create an experiment:
  - POST /experiments
  - Body:
```json
{
  "content": "### Experiment: Keto Diet and Energy Levels
- Hypothesis: Keto diet will stabilize energy levels.
- Method: Track meals and energy scores hourly.",
  "meta": { "title": "Keto Diet", "tags": ["health","nutrition"], "visibility":"public" }
}
```

- Read experiments:
  - GET /experiments
  - Optional: GET /experiments/{id}

- Update an experiment:
  - PATCH /experiments/{id}
  - Body:
```json
{
  "content": "### Experiment: Keto Diet and Energy Levels
- Hypothesis: Keto diet will stabilize energy levels.
- Method: ...
- Results: Preliminary positive trend.",
  "meta": { "tags": ["health","nutrition","ongoing"] }
}
```

- Delete an experiment:
  - DELETE /experiments/{id}
