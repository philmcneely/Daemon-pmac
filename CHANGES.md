- Schema includes:
  - **Basic Info**: name (required), title (required), summary
  - **Contact**: email, phone, location, website, linkedin, github
  - **Experience**: Array of work history with company, position, dates, achievements, technologies
  - **Education**: Array of educational background with institution, degree, field, dates, GPA, honors
  - **Skills**: Object with technical, languages, certifications, soft_skills arrays
  - **Projects**: Array of projects with name, description, technologies, URLs
  - **Additional**: awards, volunteer work, updated_at date

### Data Model (app/schemas.py)
- Added `ResumeData` Pydantic model for validation
- Includes proper typing with Optional fields and nested structures
- Added to `ENDPOINT_MODELS` mapping for automatic validation

### Testing (tests/)
- Added `sample_resume_data` fixture in `conftest.py` with comprehensive test data
- Added three new tests in `test_api.py`:
  - `test_resume_endpoint_specific_validation()` - Full resume data test
  - `test_resume_minimal_data()` - Test with only required fields
  - `test_resume_missing_required_fields()` - Validation error test

## üìù Attribution Updates

- **Header section**: Clear identification as "example implementation" of Daniel Miessler's Daemon project
- **Attribution note**: Prominent note explaining relationship to original project
- **Core Endpoints**: Updated to reference "Based on Original Daemon Project"
- **Added resume endpoint** to the endpoints list
- **New Attribution section**: Comprehensive section covering:
  - Link to original Daemon project and Daniel Miessler's profile
  - Explanation of what this implementation provides beyond the original concept
  - Key differences from the original (database, auth, deployment, etc.)
  - Related projects in Daniel's ecosystem (Substrate, Fabric, TELOS)
  - Clear statement about independent development and respect for original vision

### PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md Updates

4. **Education**: Academic background with honors and GPA
5. **Skills Categorization**: Technical skills, languages, certifications, soft skills
6. **Projects**: Portfolio projects with descriptions and links
7. **Recognition**: Awards and volunteer work
8. **Versioning**: Updated_at field for tracking resume versions

## üîó API Usage Examples

```bash

  "title": "Software Engineer",
  "summary": "Experienced developer...",
  "contact": {
    "email": "john@example.com",
